Experiment 5: Exploring Different IoT devices

Bluetooth:
Bluetooth Classic: Used for short-range peer-to-peer communication 
(e.g., connecting a phone to a speaker). 
Itâ€™s low power and suitable for audio streaming.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): Designed for low-power applications 
(e.g., wearables, sensors). 
BLE 5 supports mesh networking and longer range.

WiFi Direct:
A peer-to-peer WiFi technology that 
allows devices to communicate directly without an access point. 
Useful for data transfer between nearby devices.

Zigbee:
A low-power, low-data network protocol for IoT devices. 
Zigbee operates in the 2.4 GHz band and is commonly used in home automation 
and industrial applications.

Z-Wave:
Proprietary wireless technology for home automation. 
Unlike Zigbee and BLE, Z-Wave uses a sub-1GHz band, 
providing better range within homes.

NFC (Near Field Communication):
Extremely short-range communication (within a few centimeters). 
Used for contactless payments, pairing devices, 
and data exchange (e.g., tapping a card or phone to pay).

LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network):
Designed for long-range communication (up to several kilometers) 
with low power consumption. 
Ideal for connecting remote sensors and devices to the cloud
